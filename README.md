## Introduction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, etc. The model is trained using the Random Forest algorithm and evaluates its performance using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). It consists of health-related attributes for Pima Indian women, along with a target variable indicating diabetes diagnosis.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset (diabetes.csv) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

To use the model for prediction:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
   Follow the instructions to input the required features.

## Features

### Notes:

- Replace `your-username` in the GitHub clone link with your actual GitHub username.
- Ensure to include a `requirements.txt` file if there are specific library dependencies.
- Provide clear instructions in the README for installation, usage, and any specific setup requirements (e.g., dataset download).
- Use badges (like Python version, license) to provide quick insights into the project.

This README structure aims to provide a clear and organized overview of your project, making it easy for others to understand, use, and contribute to your diabetes prediction model repository on GitHub. Adjust the content as per your specific implementation details and preferences.
